    "# Mathematical Foundations of the FIPS-Certified PQC Algorithms\n",

    "This notebook surveys the mathematics behind the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes standardized by NIST and published as FIPS 203 (ML-KEM / Kyber), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA / Dilithium), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+). It is designed as a reference companion to algorithm-focused notebooks: you can run the few lightweight Python snippets to build intuition for the underlying algebra, lattices, and hash trees used by the schemes."

    "## 1. Mathematical Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The standardized schemes rely on overlapping primitives. This section reviews the shared mathematical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Polynomial Rings Modulo $x^n + 1$\n",
    "Let $R_q = \\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/(x^n + 1)$ with $n$ a power of two and $q$ prime. Elements are polynomials\n",
    "$$a(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} \\pmod{x^n + 1, q}.$$\n",
    "Negacyclic reduction ($x^n \\equiv -1$) couples indices and enables structured lattices. Addition is coefficient-wise, multiplication wraps using the modulus polynomial and reduces modulo $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 $q$-ary Lattices and Modules\n",
    "A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the integer span of linearly independent vectors. PQC schemes use **module lattices**, where basis vectors come from polynomial ring coefficients. For $k$-dimensional modules $R_q^k$, the lattice inherits the ring's negacyclic symmetry. Hardness assumptions generalize Learning With Errors (LWE) and Short Integer Solutions (SIS) to this module setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Module-LWE (MLWE) and Module-SIS (MSIS)\n",
    "- **MLWE**: Given $(A, t = As + e)$ for random $A \\in R_q^{k\times k}$, secret $s$ drawn from a small distribution, and noise $e$, distinguish $t$ from uniform. ML-KEM directly encodes agreements as MLWE samples.\n",
    "- **MSIS**: Find a short vector $z \n",
    "eq 0$ such that $Az = 0 mod q$. ML-DSA reduces unforgeability to the hardness of MSIS/MLWE, leveraging the Fiat-Shamir with aborts paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Discrete Gaussian and Centered Binomial Distributions\n",
    "Secrets/noise use bounded, symmetric distributions approximating discrete Gaussians. For implementation, centered binomial distributions $\text{CBD}_\\eta$ sample differences of $\\eta$ uniform bits, giving coefficients in $[-\\eta, \\eta]$ with tight bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Hash-Based Combiners\n",
    "SLH-DSA uses cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256 / SHAKE256) to build Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS+), FORS (Forest of Random Subsets) signatures, and hypertree-based Merkle authentication. Security stems from the preimage and collision resistance of the underlying hashes."

    "- **Algebraic versus combinatorial hardness**: ML-KEM and ML-DSA share lattice/module assumptions and efficient polynomial arithmetic, while SLH-DSA relies solely on hash-function security.\n",
    "- **Performance**: ML-KEM offers the smallest ciphertexts and best throughput; ML-DSA balances signing cost with verification speed; SLH-DSA produces larger signatures but provides a conservative safety net.\n",
    "- **Implementation focus**: hardware acceleration of the NTT and constant-time rejection sampling are crucial for ML-KEM/ML-DSA. SPHINCS+ favors parallel hash pipelines and memory bandwidth.\n",
    "- **Parameter selection**: each FIPS document details strict bounds on decryption failure (ML-KEM), signature rejection probability (ML-DSA), and multi-target security for the hash tree (SLH-DSA). Designers must track these bounds when porting or optimizing implementations."
